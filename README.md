### A Moo Setup for the Telekommunisten Assembly

##### Telekommunisten Assembly

Telekomumunisten have participated in CCC and Transmediale for
many years. 

This year, with
[37c3](https://events.ccc.de/2020/06/06/aktueller-stand-zum-37c3/)  and
[Transmediale:
Transformation](https://transmediale.de/content/ctm-announces-festival-theme-2021-transformation)
facing the pandemic, it looks like these events will happen remotely, if at
all.

Having attended a few online conferences in the past few months,
I've found the experience painful and mostly useless.

This is odd, since we've doing interesting things online for decades now.

Trying to engage with bad online experiences based on commercial conferencing
platforms and bulky web technology, made me remember the days of LambdaMoo, and
how fun and inventive these user-built interactive text environments where.

Maybe it was simply easier when it was simpler. You had to learn weird
commands, and type help a lot, but since it was all text, the technical bar of
entry was still low. Once you mastered some simple command making your own
areas and objects and decorating yourself was easy as writing.

Since we can also have links, these text environment can provide a core social
baseline that links out to richer media without being constrained by it.

Also, these links don't just have to go to YouTube and Zoom, I'm also reminded
of the projects of Michelle Teran, Jeff Mann and Graham Smith that
I participated over the past few decades, like LiveForm:Telekenics and others,
that did so much more with the online space that we're seeing today.

This is my starter kit for playing around with the moo software. It is based on
[toaststunt](https://github.com/lisdude/toaststunt) a fork of a fork of the
original LambdaMoo from the 90s,
[blightmud](https://github.com/LiquidityC/Blightmud) a mudclient, and
[wetty](https://github.com/butlerx/wetty) a javascript ssh client.

If you gave git installed and [docker](https://docker.com) running, you can run my kit if you clone this repo, cd into it and type:

```
./moo
```

Once you it's up and running, you can open this link to connect: http://127.0.0.1:3000

You can also access it with telnet or a mudclient on port 7777

This is only accessible on your own computer (127.0.0.1), and so only for
yourself, however, the tricks you learn will be useful when Telekommunisten
launch our assembly, which will be persistent and accessible to all.

Any building you do in your version will not be part of our shared world, but
it's good to play with and learn on until the persistent world is online.

The way to learn is experiment, search the web for "LambdaMoo", this is a 30
year old platform, there is a ton of history and information online, and yeah,
type help a lot and read what it says on the screen.

[Telekommunisten Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pQV97gY) server is a good place to ask for help for now.
